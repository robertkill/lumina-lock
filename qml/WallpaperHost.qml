// Renders the active wallpaper. This is the *only* place that knows how a
// wallpaper is drawn; LockScreen.qml stays wallpaper-agnostic.
//
// - Static images use Image with aspect-crop.
// - Video uses MediaPlayer + VideoOutput (looped, muted) with a poster frame
//   kept on top until the first frame has actually been rendered.
//
// The stack is ordered static image, video, poster, and a plain gradient on
// top of all of it. Everything is revealed by fading the layer above it OUT,
// never by fading content in: a Rectangle's and an Image's opacity reliably
// blend, while a VideoOutput's does not. Fading the video in against the
// gradient looks like it should work and does not — the QML opacity animates
// from 0 to 1 while the composited output changes in a single frame. Keeping
// the video at full opacity and dissolving what is above it gets the same
// result through an opacity that does blend.
//
// Every screen runs this component, so a video wallpaper decodes once per
// screen (the decoder is released while the lock is hidden, see the Loader).
